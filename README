                  The luaewts library and TeX package
                  
The luaewts library is a simple parser for the EWTS tibetan notation, as
on http://www.thlib.org/reference/transliteration/#essay=/thl/ewts/intro/ . The
library itself simply provides ewts.translate in lua which takes a string of 
EWTS written tibetan an returns the Unicode equivalent.

Other files present in this package are packages and examples for TeX (working
only with the LuaTeX engine). See the example to see how to use it.

Note that the parser is not fully equal to the one you can find here
http://www.digitaltibetan.org/cgi-bin/wylie.pl as it respects the EWTS system
more carefully (especially on the standard stacks) and is thus more rigid, but
faster.


Installing:
===========

To install the package the first thing you need is to build the library. You
need a C building chain, flex and also the lua headers to achieve this.

Once you installed everything, launch the ./build.sh script, and it will produce
LuaEWTS_lib.so (or .dll for Windows). You can also cross-compile from Linux to
Windows with Mingw32 by passing the --mingw option to ./build.sh. Note that you
need lua51.dll to cross-compile; this file can be found in the LuaXML archive.

Once you have LuaEWTS_lib.so, put it in a directory searchable by Lua(TeX) and
everything should work fine.
